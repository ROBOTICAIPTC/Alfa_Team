 ##  Technical data
 ### LEGO Spike Prime 
 
 SPIKE™ Prime from LEGO Education is a complete learning solution that unites hands-on play with digital coding experiences. Drag-and-drop programming and learning units within the SPIKE Prime app are passed to the programmable hub to bring physical builds to life. Regardless of the device you use, the design, programming and functionality of the app are the same. The SPIKE Prime app is required to use the set, as there is no scheduling function on the hub.
* Specifications and main features:
Sturdy storage box with sorting trays, programmable hub, distance sensor, force sensor, color sensor, large motor, 2 medium motors and over 500 LEGO Technic elements with an attractive design and a new color palette.
Programmable hub with a 5 x 5 light matrix, 6 input/output ports, integrated 6-axis gyroscope, speaker, Bluetooth connectivity and rechargeable battery.
The advanced yet easy-to-use LEGO Technic SPIKE Prime Hub is a brick-shaped device that includes 6 input/output ports to connect to a range of sensors and motors, a customizable 5 x 5 light matrix, Bluetooth connectivity, speaker, 6-axis gyroscope, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, and a micro USB port to connect to compatible tablets and computers. Additionally, the Large Hub is compatible with LEGO Technic elements to create fun robots, dynamic devices, and other interactive models.

### Engines

* The LEGO Technic Large Angular Motor features an integrated rotation sensor and absolute positioning for proper directional control, the ideal solution for more powerful and high-torque constructions.
Perfect for very powerful and high-torque applications.
Tachometer feedback control with an accuracy of 1°.
Zero point marks for easy calibration.
Simple form factor for quick building and rebuilding
* The LEGO Technic Medium Angular Motor features a compact design, integrated rotation sensor with absolute positioning, and precision of 1 degree. It is ideal for lower-load applications and offers rapid response capabilities.
Key features include:
Compact Design: Suitable for smaller models with limited space.
Integrated Rotation Sensor: Ensures accurate directional control.
Simple Form Factor: Facilitates quick building and rebuilding.
This motor is perfect for applications requiring efficient performance in a smaller footprint, making it a versatile choice for various LEGO Technic projects

### Sensors

* The LEGO Technic Color Sensor distinguishes between 8 colors and measures both ambient and reflected light, ranging from darkness to bright sunlight.
Key features include:
High-Accuracy Sampling: A sample rate of 1kHz provides consistent and precise data for repeatable results.
Color Detection: Capable of detecting 8 different colors.
Light Measurement: Measures the intensity of reflected white light as well as ambient light.
Simple Form Factor: Designed for quick building and rebuilding.
This sensor is ideal for projects requiring accurate color detection and light measurement in various lighting conditions
* The ultrasonic sensor measures distance using ultrasonic waves. The sensor head emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the reflected wave that returns from the object. Ultrasonic sensors calculate the distance to the object by timing the interval between emission and reception.
Key Features:
Distance Measurement: Accurately measures the distance to objects by analyzing the time it takes for the sound wave to return.
Ultrasonic Technology: Utilizes sound waves beyond the range of human hearing for precise detection.
This sensor is ideal for applications requiring accurate distance measurement in robotics and automation projects.
* image sensor Huskylens
  The HuskyLens is an easy-to-use AI-based machine vision camera with several key features and functions:
Key Features
Processor: Kendryte K210 chip for efficient image processing tasks
Image Sensor: Available in two versions - OV2640 2.0MP or OV5640 5.0MP
Display: 2.0 inch IPS screen for visualizing images and configuring parameters without a computer
Connectivity: Easily connects to platforms like Arduino, micro:bit and Raspberry Pi via I2C and UART ports for seamless integration into various projects
Power Supply: Works with 3.3 to 5.0V, but may require an external power source due to its current consumption
Functions
The HuskyLens offers six main operating modes:
Face Recognition: Identifies and stores faces, enabling personalized interactions
Object Recognition: Capable of identifying and classifying different objects in the environment
Line Following: Allows mobile devices to follow trajectories marked on the ground
Object Tracking: Keeps focus on a moving object
Color Recognition: Identifies and distinguishes between different colors
Tag Identification: Reads QR codes and other types of tags, facilitating interaction with the environment
The HuskyLens is particularly useful for educators and robotics enthusiasts, as it enables developing creative projects without delving into complex programming, making machine vision technology accessible to all.
  ### Mobility
  The robot is designed to follow a specific path in a straight line until the ultrasonic sensor detects an exterior wall. At the beginning of its journey, the robot advances continuously, moving in a straight line with precision. However, when approaching a wall, the ultrasonic sensor emits a signal that activates the stop mechanism. At this time, the robot stops immediately to avoid a collision. Once stopped, the robot begins a backward process to move away from the wall. After backing up a safe distance, the robot turns 40 degrees to the side. This turn allows you to change your direction and continue exploring the surrounding area.The robot is programmed to repeat this detection and reaction process until it has recorded a total of 12 encounters with the exterior wall. In each of these encounters, the robot stops, reverses and turns, ensuring that its trajectory is safe and controlled. Finally, after completing the 12 detections, the robot makes a final adjustment in its direction to return to the starting point, thus completing its journey in an efficient and orderly manner. This behavior not only demonstrates the robot’s ability to interact with its environment, but also illustrates fundamental principles of programming and robotics, such as obstacle detection and real-time decision making. 
  ### Energy
The SPIKE Prime system motors depend on the power supplied by the battery to operate. By receiving the control signal from the hub, the motors can rotate, move forward or reverse, allowing the robot to perform various tasks and movements. The battery ensures that the motors operate continuously and efficiently, which is essential to maintain performance during learning sessions.
